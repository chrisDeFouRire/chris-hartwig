## Cloudflare Workers Types

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Do not use `@cloudflare/workers-types` as it's deprecated.

Instead, use the types generated by Wrangler:

```bash
npx wrangler types
```

This will generate the appropriate types automatically in `worker-configuration.d.ts`.

## Database Migrations

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Never modify existing migration files. If changes are needed to the database schema, always create a new migration file that applies the necessary changes using ALTER statements or similar.

Modifying existing migration files can cause issues in production environments where those migrations have already been applied. The correct approach is to create a new migration file that builds upon the existing schema.

## Astro Pages and Components

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: When creating interactive elements in Astro pages, prefer using React components with appropriate client directives (e.g., `client:load`, `client:visible`) rather than client-side scripts.

This approach provides better maintainability, type safety, and follows the project's established patterns for interactive components.
