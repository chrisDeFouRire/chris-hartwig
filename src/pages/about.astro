            I'm Chris, a developer who has been working remotely from abroad
            since 2014. My journey has taken me across multiple time zones
            (UTC-4 to UTC+8), from the Carribean to Southeast Asia, always with
            a focus on backend engineering, devops, and SSL/TLS technologies.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">My Journey with Technology</h2>
        <p>
          With years of experience in backend engineering and devops, I've seen
          technology evolve dramatically. From managing distributed systems
          across continents to implementing security protocols, I've navigated
          the complexities of modern software development.
        </p>

        <p>
          My focus has always been on the infrastructure and systems that power
          applications. From SSL/TLS expertise to gaming backend architectures,
          I've worked on the foundations that make digital experiences possible.

          Exploring AI in Software Engineering
        </h3>
        <p>
          Today, I'm fascinated by how artificial intelligence is transforming
          software engineering. As someone who has built complex backend
          systems, I'm particularly interested in how AI tools are changing the
          way we design, build, and maintain software.

          Remote Engineering & Distributed Systems
        </h3>
        <p>
          My experience building systems while working remotely across multiple
          countries has given me unique perspectives on distributed development
          workflows. I explore how AI tools can enhance collaboration and
          productivity for distributed engineering teams.
